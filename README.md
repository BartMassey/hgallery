HGallery is a [Haskell](http://haskell.org) /
[Yesod](http://yesodweb.com) server-side web photo gallery.
It eventually aims to provide persistence, versioning and
archivable metadata. It is very much a work in progress.

HGallery is made available under the "GNU AGPL v3", as
specified the terms in the file COPYING in this
distribution.
